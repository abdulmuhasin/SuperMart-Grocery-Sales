# SuperMart-Grocery-Sales
<b>Objective:</b><br>
This project focuses on using a dataset containing information about grocery sales at a supermart.We’ll explore this data, perform feature engineering, and build a machine learning model to predict sales<br>
The dataset includes columns such as Order ID,Customer Name,Category, Sub Category, City, Order Date, Region, Sales, Discount,Profit, State, month_no, Month, and year.<br>
On this ML Project performs EDA,Handling Outliers,Uses different visualization tools,Restructure Date column,label encoding for categorical values for convertion,Linear regression for model building,and check the MSE and R2 for perfection.<br>
At last the model is performs well<br>
MSE is 126.98 it lower MSE indicates better model performance. the MSE is relatively low, meaning the model's predictions are quite close to the actual values.R² value is closer to 1 indicate that the model explains most of the variance. An R² of 0.9617 means your model explains around 96% of the variance in the data
